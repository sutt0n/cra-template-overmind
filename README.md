This Create React App template was created to integrate [overmindjs](https://github.com/cerebral/overmind) and [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). It was inspired by the United States Tax Court's [DAWSON](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms) project. All business logic is separated out from the UI, thus _renders_ (see what I did there?) unit testing [most] React components pointless.

# Developer Note

This is still in _early_ development (literally, it was born yesterday). Some features may or may not work intermittently.

# Usage

First, clone this repository to a directory. Then, run:

`npx create-react-app my-app --template --file:./path/to-cloned/repo/cra-template-overmind`
